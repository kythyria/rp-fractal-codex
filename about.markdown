Calraith
Full name: Dr Calraith Sorrel von Grafune, PhD (Spiral), MsC (Ava), OLC, RGS
Nickname: Cal
Default form: Biyomon
Evolution graph: Puwamon → Poromon → Biyomon → Airdramon
Switches between the latter two according to if there’s space in the room and whether hands are needed.

Appearance: For the first two, pretty standard. The biyomon form is slightly more bestial and has a toothy beak, as well as frequently wearing a skull-like helm with metallic trim (it’s augmented). The airdramon’s skullface is outright inlaid with metal that looks like circuit traces, and is normally wearing a leather-looking harness with pockets, saddle, and chest-mounted cameras (don’t ask how that combines with serpent locomotion. Lens caps, probably).

Personality: A very analytical engineer type; but also a rather dirty fighter. Screw the Queensbury Rules (however those could even work with so many different body shapes on display), find a weak point and fill it with damage from anything handy, such as the scenery. Mostly though, she’s more about not the fighting, but building stuff. Which might be handy in a fight, or it might just be handy. Likes maps. Kind of is the map, some of the time.

Backstory: Cal originally studied non-euclidean cartography at &uni_ava;. This was going well, she was doing a report on buildings whose internal shape is only defined by where the doors in each room are, when she met the particular cadre of boffins that inhabited the Institute For Advanced Thinking. Specifically, the Department For Research Of Mon Potential. Their lab actually made a good case study: it looks perfectly fine until you actually add up the rest of the building.

Anyway, the DRMP studies ways to tinker with the internals of digimon, and they needed a few more avian test subjects, so she volunteered. Nothing major at first, but then, having determined most of her probable digivolutions would a) fly and b) be large enough to ride, suggested trying to install their new heads-up display. That is, a device for generating one for other people. Long story short, it worked, and Cal liked it enough (partly thanks to the mundane utility of using it instead of overhead transparencies) that a lifelong tendency was born, namely the tendency to devise and/or install an upgrade rather than get stronger by beating up other digimon.


Actually becoming an airdramon wasn’t until after she’d joined the Geographical Society and graduated. Unfortunately for her, this was during an expedition–the RGS has plenty of explorers, and this team wanted a small bird as a kind of messenger pigeon–during which a set of abandoned ruins turned out to be not so ruined, abandoned, or purely architectural as they looked.

To cut a long story which makes more mention of tapioca, skateboarding, and metric spanners short, this provoked Calraith’s first digivolution into airdramon, albeit at the cost of a torn wing membrane and several hairline cracks to her exoskull that took a long time indeed to mend and there’s still a slight discolouration at the seams despite digivolution normally resetting that sort of thing. It was while recovering from this (after slithering home, can’t fly with a torn wing) she started thinking of a few more enhancements, though they wouldn’t be installed just yet. She also watched this anime in which the villain was this guy who dressed in a lot of purple and enormous shades. World domination or not, she couldn’t fault his style, riding around on an Airdramon like that.

After that, she decided to spend a while staying out of fights, and switched to taking aerial photographs instead, something which requires very precise, consistent, flying. Most digimon would train, but as already mentioned, Cal prefers upgrades, and improving the photographs is where she got the ability to use the camera harness as extra eyes. Not wanting to mistake ancient installations for merely ancient buildings is what prompted such drastically overengineered “eyes”, though.

Sometime during this is when she was approached by the Order of the Lambda Calculus, who are only mostly ceremonial, and admitted with the title of Geometric Scholar. Though any member can be called upon to do the action thing, the descriptions of her title are all about maps, diagrams, and the like.
Abilities
HUD Illusion: A very specialised form of illusion effect. Anyone within range can see a kind of heads-up display directly in their vision. Displays three flavours of object, AR-like (floating in world space), waypoint-like (screen-space, but move to track a world-space point), or purely screen-space (eg, subtitles). Cal generally uses it instead of whispering or a whiteboard, but the original purpose was to provide flight instruments for a rider, and later targeting assist if the rider is a mon.

Omniradio: Chances are, if it exists, she can speak it. Or radiate it, or whatever it is one does with RF protocols. She sounds a little odd over high-quality voice protocols, due to not actually using a microphone. She doesn’t have all the protocols ever on file, though. Just a lot of them.

Sensor suite: Cal can see your house from up here. And count the roof tiles. And grade the insulation, if it’s a cold day. Those chest-mounted cameras are bigger than small digimon, and her actual eyes are no slouches either. Two dozen primary colours (covering a wider range than human eyes do, and with less overlap), polarisation, certain kinds of spatial distortion (ala the ribbon goggles in Tri), and energy radiated by digimon. She has to be airdramon to do this though, the requisite equipment just doesn’t fit in a biyomon. Her rookie eyes are merely very sharp.
