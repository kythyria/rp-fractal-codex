# Organisations
Mew proposed an organisation called the Templars that try to keep the human and digimon worlds separate.

Crys proposed an organisation called DEC (Digital Empowerment Corporation): “works to not only help digimon and humans live together peacefully in both worlds, but also utilizing the tech they're discovering with the expanded exploration and understanding of the digital world”. Sort of the opposite of the Templars, and produce the D-PAS system Crys occasionally references.
