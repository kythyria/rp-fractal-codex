# Appearance
Basically a normal zudomon, aside from having a belt on which the hammer is hung any time he needs both hands free or just hasn't remembered to pick it up again. Under normal circumstances, probably has one or more flunkies either following him around or just perched on his shell. Has quite a deep, cultured, voice, the kind where you can _hear_ the monocle, top hat, cigar, and glass of very expensive liquor, whether or not there are any in the vicinity.

# Bio
Simon isn't some grand warrior, or rather, he isn't a grand warrior _in person_. His approach to the prospect of a difficult fight is to go away and return in a suitably pugnacious airship, and well it might, for his normal occupation is the construction, repair, and decomissioning of these, armed to the teeth or otherwise.

By &ldquo;airship&rdquo; we largely mean the steampunk-through-dieselpunk-y sailing-ship-with-a-gasbag-for-sails type, though he does know how to produce other sorts that fly using less obvious means of elevation. Being as most of these are big, this is why he has the flunkies, to help him keep track of all the mons and materials needed to build ships.

However, in a sort of non-combat version of the Authority Equals Asskicking trope, he does know at least the basics of the jobs of all his minions, even the ones he can't really substitute for due to differences in elemental affinity, movelist, size, or so forth. Aside from that, he has the strongest affinity, naturally, for brute force metalwork, what with the hammer and all.

He tends to hide a lot of stuff in his shell, it's anyone's guess how it gets in or out, but there it is.
